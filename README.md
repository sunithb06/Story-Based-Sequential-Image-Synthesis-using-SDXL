# Story-Based-Sequential-Image-Synthesis-using-SDXL
This project generates sequential images from stories using Stable Diffusion XL with ControlNet (Canny). It supports simple and story-specific prompts enhanced by character, object, environment, and style details. The system evaluates outputs using CLIP similarity, SSIM, and diversity scores, with an interactive Gradio interface.
